## Getting Started

Mongli is my personal project for 🌱beginner🌱 developers.
So you can use my code for your development!
Mongli is being managed in Notion📝
To use my code, I recommend visit [Notion](https://www.notion.so/mongli/Mongli-while-dreaming-73d75833c8b44438911e7e360e5cb8b6).

#### For using JWT

you must provide private key. This could be the contents of a privateKey file generated via the following **Terminal commands**:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f privateKey
# Don't add a passphrase
```



#### For changing the mysql port

Please refer to the [link](https://daeun28.github.io/삽질사전/mac에서_mysql_포트_변경하기-post/).
